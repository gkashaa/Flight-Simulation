# Flight-Simulation

This program simulates the flights of a number of airplanes. The simulation scenario consists of a set of cities joined by flight paths and a set of defined airline flights between those cities. 

When started the application will ask the user to input the name of a text file giving the names of the two data files (City and Aircraft/Flight). At 5 second intervals, a report will be printed on the screen giving the current scenario clock time and information on all flights currently in route. 

Flight information includes the airline, flight number, type of aircraft, the departure city symbol, latitude and longitude, the time of departure, the arrival city symbol, latitude and longitude, the estimated time of arrival, the current location of the aircraft in latitude and longitude, the number of miles from the departure city, the number of miles to the destination city, the cruise speed of the aircraft, and the current altitude.

Note: This program can only run on Visual Studio
